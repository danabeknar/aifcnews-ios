# aifcnews-ios
This application was developed under [N17R](https://n17r.com/) 3 years ago in collaboration with [AIFC](https://aifc.kz/). The code is a little bit ugly, probably isn't even worth to see, yet it reminds me a beginning of my career, so here we are :)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:aitemr/aifcnews-ios.git
$ cd aifcnews-ios
```
2. Install dependencies from [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/#install)
```bash
$ pod install
```
3. Open the Xcode workspace at `aifcnews.xcworkspace`.
